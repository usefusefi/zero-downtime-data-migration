# Zero-Downtime Data Migration Across Cloud Providers

This repository contains production-ready source code and infrastructure-as-code examples for executing **zero-downtime data migrations** of petabyte-scale datasets across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## Features

- Apache Spark jobs optimized for petabyte-scale incremental data migration
- Kubernetes-native deployment examples for Spark and Airflow
- Apache Airflow DAG for orchestrating migration workflows
- Terraform modules for multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Real-time migration monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- Rollback and recovery framework supporting multiple strategies
- Network optimization utilities for cross-cloud data transfer

## Getting Started

1. **Spark Migration Job**: Configure your source and target cloud storage URIs in `spark_migration/migration_job.py` and run the Spark job on your Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Orchestration**: Deploy the Airflow DAG located in `airflow_dag/petabyte_migration_dag.py` to manage migration workflows.

3. **Infrastructure**: Use Terraform configurations under `terraform/` to provision cloud resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

4. **Monitoring**: Run `monitoring/migration_monitor.py` to expose Prometheus metrics for migration progress and health.

5. **Rollback**: Use the rollback manager in `rollback/rollback_manager.py` to handle migration failures and recovery.

6. **Network Optimization**: Utilize `network_optimization/network_optimizer.py` to measure and optimize cross-cloud bandwidth.
